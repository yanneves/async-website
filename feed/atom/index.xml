Think like an English teacher.</p>
<p>The days of grammar drills and awkward roleplays may be behind us, but there’s more than a passing similarity between learning a foreign language and learning to code. Just like English, French and Klingon, programming languages like JavaScript and Go are underpinned by systems (grammar and vocabulary) and skills (reading and writing), so why shouldn’t we use the same approach to teach them?</p>
<p>Drawing on my own experience teaching English as a foreign language, I’ll take you through some of the most useful language-teaching techniques and how you can use them in a technical context - whether you&#39;re coaching a new developer on your team, or writing documentation for a bank employing hundreds of developers.</p>

On Thurs 2nd July 2020 at 19:30 we are organising a <strong>&quot;Two dimensional Show and Tell&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>This will be an online version of the <a href="https://asyncjs.com/international-show-n-tell-2019/">International show and tell</a> that we run every year before <a href="https://ffconf.org/">FFConf</a>. It&#39;ll be a great opportunity to watch a variety of speakers each give a five-minute presentation on something exciting related to the web.</p>
<p>The meeting will be taking place on zoom, so please sign up to the event on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/271442327/">meetup.com</a> to get access to the link.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in giving a talk, we&#39;d love to hear from you. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what&#39;s on your mind. You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.</p>
<p>If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/271442327/">meetup event</a> including:</p>

<p>On the evening of 21 May, we will be hosting on an online version of our popular <strong>&quot;Ask the Brains&quot;</strong> event. Inspired by the monthly Brighton <a href="http://brightonalt.net/">ALT.NET meetup</a>, we will be asking/talking/ranting about everything web-related - 5 - 10 minutes per topic.</p>
<p>The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their <em>&quot;that thing you&#39;ve never understood but always been too afraid to ask&quot;</em> type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night. Topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m new to development. Where do I get started?</li>
<li>I still don&#39;t get it! What the hell does <code>this</code> mean in Javascript?</li>
<li><code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, or is there a case for both</li>
<li>Do we have to accept that JavaScript is now a compiled language</li>
<li>How do you maintain a work-life balance</li>
<li>Should I write unit tests, integration tests, or both?</li>
<li>What are the beneficial aspects of Agile/Scrum, and what do you find less useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the online discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes to stay can share a virtual pint.</p>
<p>The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.</p>
<p>So, please put your thinking caps on now and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask.</p>
<p>Please sign up to the event on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/270599931/">meetup.com</a>. We also highly recommend you sign up to the Async Slack channel for more info, and updates.</p>

To mark the occasion, a motley group of web nerds gathered at CERN, the birthplace of the web, to build a time machine. The first ever web browser was, confusingly, called WorldWideWeb. What if we could recreate the experience of using it ...but within a modern browser! Join (Je)Remy on a journey through time and space and code as they excavate the foundations of Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s gloriously ambitious and hacky hypertext system that went on to conquer the world.</p>

<p>In this session you will learn about tooling, frameworks, and architectural patterns focused on building a web application from front to back. Along the way we will discuss best practices to help you get a started on developing without needing to manage servers. I will demo the solutions, and show how you can integrate these common web app features with minimal code.</p>

This talks aims to unpick this uncanny prescience by imagining a world where Kubernetes does not exist and investigating how we would solve problems with standardisation and operation of modern applications without it.</p>
<p>No Kubernetes experiences is expected, but an awareness of servers and some JS experience would be helpful</p>

But dig a little deeper, and you&#39;ll see that while things are pretty rosy for statically-hosted apps, there&#39;s a rapid increase in complexity when adding server-side logic or rendering. In this talk, we&#39;ll look at how that manifests, what it means for each of your apps &amp; the open-source landscape at large, and how a new project, Frontend Application Bundles or FABs, can help solve it.</p>

Brighton local Oli Sharpe has been researching ideas about how one would build a contemporary programming language given how we use computers today. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.shift-society.org/salon/papers/2018/revised/semprola.pdf">Semprola</a> is the programming language he is developing as a result of this research. The Async talk will first give a brief overview of the thinking behind the ideas of Semprola, a language in which you work with semiotic signs in contexts rather than symbols in text files. Then there will be a brief demo of where Semprola is at today, followed by a short explanation of the way that Javascript is being used to create the (rudimentary!) integrated Semprola IDE.</p>
<p>This won&#39;t be a deep dive into the compiler (or VM!) but the audience will be assumed to have basic understanding of programming.</p>

<li>How big do I let a project get before using Redux?</li>
<li>What actually is a database index anyway?</li>
<li>What VS Code plugins can you not live without?</li>
<li>Is it just me, or is React Router 5 rubbish?</li>
<li>Should I write unit tests, integration tests, or both?</li>
</ul>
